# MVC-blog-site

## Description

MVC blogs is an application where users can connect by reading and commenting on others blogs, or creating a profile and posting their own blogs. The motivation for the application was a simple MVC blog application with a simple UI, that still had the feel of professionalism and community by using created profiles to interact with other users. In doing this project, I learned how to take existing code and edit it for my UI needs.

## Installation

To install this project, one simple has to open the deployed application provided by Heroku and begin exploring.

## Usage

Once the application is open, a user can browse the home page and look at existing blog posts. If one wants to login or create a profile, they may do so by clicking "login" in the navbar. From the login page, they can click the link to "sign up here", as shown in screenshot 1 below. Once a user has logged in, they may view their profile, where they may add new posts and view all previously added posts, as shown in screenshot 2. Don't forget to click on a blog post to add and view comments, as shown in screenshot 3 below.

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
